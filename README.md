# NLP-Poetry-Generation-in-Urdu
I have used n-gram language modeling to generate some poetry using the spaCy library for
text processing. For the purpose of this work, a poem will consist of three stanzas each containing four
verses where each verse consists of 7â€”10 words. For example, following is a manually generated stanza.
for reference please check dataset or report.

The task is to print three such stanzas with an empty line in between. The generational model is trained
on the provided Poetry Corpus containing poems from Faiz, Ghalib and Iqbal. I have trained unigram and
bigram models using this corpus. This models will be used to generate poetry. Several online solutions are
available for English that use the NLTK library. However, I have used the spaCy library to accomplish this
task!
